+check for stability (constraints for krho, kalpha, kbeta)
+also apply for backwards case not within bounds of alpha**
+put in a couple sentences at the end of Motion Model section

Can you also try to clarify these phrases slightly?

"of the robot normal vector relative to the x axis"
(I know what you're trying to say by robot normal, but it isn't very clear)

"defines the error of the robot normal vector relative to the desired angle relative to the goal."
(two relatives is confusing)

"the angle of the goal vector relative to the horizontal"
(which horizontal?)
